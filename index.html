The motherboard connects all these components, ensuring they communicate effectively. Power supply units (PSU) convert electrical energy to power the system, while graphics processing units (GPU) enhance visual output, especially in gaming and graphic design. Input devices such as keyboards and mice allow users to interact with the computer, while output devices like monitors and printers present information. Networking components enable internet connectivity, and cooling systems help prevent overheating. Together, these hardware elements form the foundation of any <del>computing</del> <ints>computers</ints> system, enabling a wide range of applications and functionalities and comupter build <sup>(1997).</sup</p></font>
